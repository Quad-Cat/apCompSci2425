AP Computer Science A 2024-2025 Textbook

Every lab folder should have 3 folders:
1. notes - These are the PDF notes of the current lesson, the lab instructions are at the end of the notes
2. base_code - This is a template folder for you to write your answer solution in!
3. labOutput - This is the IDEAL answer solution. When you make your lab, try your best to replicate it.

To run the labOutput of labs do the following:
1. Right click the "labOutput" folder
2. Select "Open Terminal Here"
3. Then in that terminal, type "java starter" - This will run the program
